# Rockbuster_SQL_CF

## Project summary 
This repository contains a SQL-based analysis of Rockbuster Stealth's buisness data aimed at answering how a movie rental buisness can stay competetive in a streaming dominanted media. The goal is to leverage existing movie liscenses to create an online video rental system with only the most profitable liscenses remaining. This project focuses on on analyzing past data in order to determine the key factors for determining a successful launch of the online rental system.  

## Key Questions 
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. Here are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data and tools 
Rockbusters internal data mangament system and SQL was used for the analysis. The data set includes information on Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, payments, stores, staff, films, actors, rental history and addresses. Visualtions were created with the use of Tableau Public.
